VCS tools allow the creation of a  in order to keep alternate streams of work from conflicting with one another while also providing the ability to merge the work back together at a later point, while allowing teams of developers to verify if the changes on either branch conflict.
Software teams often adopt a practice of creating a new branch for each new feature, or to branch every time you want to create a release version.

is Git's way of putting a split branch history back together again. The git merge command lets you take separate branches and integrate them into a single branch.
git 'merge' will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. Most commonly, git merge is used to combine two 'branches'. In these scenarios, git merge takes two commits, each of the branch leafs. Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of both branches.

Git is all about managing contributions between different developers. Sometimes you may have multiple developers attempting to change the same content on different branches. If a Developer attempts to change some code that a different Developer is working on, a conflict may occur.
Merge it are what arise when two branches have edited code in the same part of the same file.
